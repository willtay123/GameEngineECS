# GameEngineECS
## A component-based C++ game engine

This engine is being designed with the goal of being fully modular, allowing it to be easily re-implemented with a range of APIs without the need to re-compile the engine.

Current demonstration of the engine uses OpenGL and has a simple "game" that demonstrates various sytems like Entity Management, collision detection and response, resource management and so on.
