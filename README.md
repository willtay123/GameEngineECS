# GameEngineECS
## A component-based C++ game engine

This engine is being designed with the goal of being fully modular, allowing it to be easily re-implemented with a range of APIs without the need to re-compile the engine.

# Repo Projects:
### Engine
Relies on GLM

### Engine Unit Tests
Incomplete - aiming to write 5 a day

### Game
Makes use of OpenGL
